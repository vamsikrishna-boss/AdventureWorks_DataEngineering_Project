# 📘 Project: Azure End-To-End Data Engineering 
## Interduction
**Objective:**

The project starts with raw data stored in Azure Blob Storage and walks through a fully orchestrated process—pulling data with Azure Data Factory, transforming it using Databricks and PySpark, and then pushing it into Azure Synapse Analytics for reporting and analysis. The tutorial also discusses best practices, security, and scaling strategies.

## 🧰 Azure Services Used in the Project

       *Azure Service*                                                         *Purpose*	                                                                         

    *Azure Blob Storage*	                                     Store raw, processed, and curated data

     Azure Data Factory	                                     Ingest and orchestrate data pipelines
 
     Azure Databricks	                                     Perform transformations with PySpark

     Azure Synapse	                                             Store structured, analytics-ready data

     Azure Key Vault	                                     Securely manage secrets and credentials

     Azure Monitor	                                             Monitor pipeline health and log activities

     Power BI / Synapse SQL	                                     Visualize and analyze curated dataset


## 🧱 Core Project Components

    Data Source – Flat files (CSV/JSON) that simulate real-world transactional data.

    Raw Data Lake – Initial storage zone in Blob Storage.

    Staging Area – Intermediate storage for uncleaned data.

    Databricks Processing – Uses PySpark notebooks to clean and join datasets.

    Synapse Analytics – Serves as the final data warehouse for BI consumption.

    Visualization Layer – Can be Power BI or Synapse Studio for analytics dashboards.

## 🗂️ Data Flow Stages:

 1. Raw Data Storage

       * Upload CSV or JSON files to Azure Blob Storage under a raw container.

 2. Data Ingestion

       * Create pipelines in Azure Data Factory (ADF) to ingest data from blob into staging.

       * Set up Linked Services, Datasets, and Pipelines.

 3. Data Transformation

       * Use Azure Databricks and PySpark notebooks to clean, filter, join, and transform data.

       * Output is written to a curated/processed zone in Blob or directly to Synapse.

 4. Data Warehousing

       * Load transformed data into Azure Synapse Analytics.

       * Use SQL Serverless Pools or Dedicated SQL Pools.

 5. Data Analysis & Visualization

       * Query data using Synapse Studio or connect with Power BI for dashboards.

 6. Monitoring & Alerts

       * Use Azure Monitor or Log Analytics for pipeline health and diagnostics.
   

## 🔐 Security Best Practices:

   * Use Azure Key Vault to store secrets for ADF, Databricks.

   * Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) on each service.

   * Enable data encryption both at rest and in transit.

## 📅 CI/CD Integration (Optional Advanced Step):

   * Version-control notebooks and ADF pipelines in Azure DevOps.

   * Create release pipelines to automate deployment of resources.
